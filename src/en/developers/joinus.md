# Join us to build the future of WebGAL

WebGAL is a visual novel/Galgame engine running on web. With the powerful cross-platform advantage of the web platform, WebGAL can run on almost any device that can run a browser. After more than two years of iteration, WebGAL is now increasingly rich in functions and its stability is also improving step by step. WebGAL is now widely used in the production of visual novel games. Its easy-to-use and efficient editor also enables game makers who lack programming experience to easily develop game works with personal characteristics.

Now, with the continuous expansion of the user group, we are constantly receiving requests for new functions and bug reports. The existing manpower can no longer support the needs of such a large number of users. Therefore, we hope that there will be a group of capable and ambitious friends who are willing to popularize the production of this type of game and revitalize visual novels/Galgames by creating simple, easy-to-use and powerful engines and production tools, and join us to build the future of WebGAL together.

## WebGAL Concept

Give talented people easy-to-use tools, and they can create masterpieces. For those engaged in scriptwriting, painting or other art professions, software development is often not their strength. But they have creativity and the passion to create ideal works. The concept of WebGAL is to lower the development threshold as much as possible, so that everyone, regardless of whether they have a programming foundation, can create their own games.

## Special Note

WebGAL is an open source project, so what we recruit are actually "contributors". We do not provide actual jobs.

## Recruitment Needs

### Web Front-end Development Engineer

#### Goal

Our goal is to develop more powerful functions for WebGAL, provide more usability improvements for WebGAL editor, and thus promote the prosperity of WebGAL ecology.

#### Basic Requirements

Be familiar with the tools and processes of web front-end development, and be familiar with the use of React framework.

#### Additional Requirements

WebGAL uses React to build the user interface and Pixi to build the game stage. So if you have experience in developing 2D games using Pixi, it will be a great help to us. In addition, innovation and software engineering capabilities are also very helpful to us. We need innovative talents to help us solve unprecedented special needs and build an efficient and stable software architecture.

The WebGAL engine kernel is a stage state model driven by a state machine. We are preparing for the next generation kernel. This kernel uses state calculation technology, which can improve the efficiency of real-time preview and may realize the advanced function of forward jump - this function is difficult for other engines to achieve. You can read our RFC to learn about our vision for the new kernel. [RFC1: WebGAL 5 Process Control and Performance Call Draft](https://openwebgal.com/en/blog/rfc1/)

### Node Back-end Development Engineer

#### Goal

The back-end of WebGAL editor is driven by Node and built using NestJS. Our goal is to build a stable, high-performance cross-platform editor back-end, providing file system access, static resource deployment, code hints, etc., and providing high-quality services for the editor front-end.

#### Basic Requirements

Be familiar with TypeScript development and Nest framework, and have relevant experience in developing cross-platform back-end services using Node.

#### Additional Requirements

We use Vscode-LanguageServer to provide code hints. If you have experience in building Language Server, it will be a great help to us.

### Translation

#### Goal

WebGAL engine, editor, and official website are now available in three languages: Chinese, English, and Japanese. However, with the rapid iteration of functions, the translation of English and Japanese is somewhat lagging behind. Our goal is to keep the documentation and graphical user interface of these languages synchronized with the main Chinese version.

#### Basic Requirements
Have good English/Japanese writing skills, be able to provide high-quality translation texts, and provide a good experience for users of other languages.

English basic requirements: CET 6 / IELTS 6+ / TOEFL 80+
Japanese basic requirements: N2

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Designer

#### Goal

WebGAL is committed to creating a pleasing graphical user interface to provide users with a good experience. Since most users do not know how to program, the default UI of the engine must be beautiful enough to attract more users. Our goal is to create a beautiful and elegant engine and editor interface to improve the productivity of WebGAL.

#### Basic Requirements

Be proficient in using Figma to design graphical user interfaces, have a good sense of aesthetics and a certain level of UX (user experience) design. Before contacting us, please prepare a portfolio that can reflect your professional level.

### Art

#### Goal

In order to demonstrate the functions of WebGAL online and provide some sample materials in WebGAL editor, we need some high-quality art materials to attract users to use our products.

#### Basic Requirements

Be familiar with two-dimensional painting and be able to create two-dimensional characters (看板娘) or two-dimensional style background pictures that meet the requirements of WebGAL.

#### Special Note

These materials will become the materials of WebGAL public material library and will be delivered to WebGAL users for free. WebGAL is an open source software, so these materials will also be open source. Open source means that our users can use and redistribute them for free, please be aware of this.
