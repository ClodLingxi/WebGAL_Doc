# Customize game info

Under the /game folder, there is a file config.txt where you can fill in relevant information about your game (you can edit it directly using the visual editor):

```
Game_name:WebGAL;//Your game name 
Game_key:0f33fdGr;//A string of identification codes, you should input a string of characters that is not easy to duplicate with others as randomly as possible, preferably 6-10 characters long, otherwise bugs may occur
Title_img:Title2.png;//The name of the title picture, the picture is placed in the /background folder
Title_bgm:夏影.mp3;//The title background music, the music file should be placed in the /bgm folder
```
