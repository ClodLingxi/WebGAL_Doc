# Manage game resources

You should be able to find that under the unzipped folder, there is a WebGAL folder. Under the WebGAL folder, there is a game folder, which is where your game resources should be stored. **(If you use the visual editor, you can directly open the corresponding resource folder in the left toolbar)**

All your game scripts, pictures, character sprites, etc. should be placed under the game folder. The resource description corresponding to the directory is as follows:
