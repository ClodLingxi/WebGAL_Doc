 # Migrating Game Files After Editor Update

WebGAL Terre editor game project files are located in the `public/games` directory. You can see the names of the games you created in this directory.

After you download or install a new editor, you can directly migrate the games from the old editor to the same directory of the new editor. Then, open the new editor and you can use them.

Generally speaking, games are backward compatible, except for major version upgrades (the first digit of the version number) where compatibility is not guaranteed.
