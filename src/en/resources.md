# Manage game resources

::: tip
If you are using the graphical editor, you can directly open the corresponding resource folder in the toolbar on the left. If you are developing based on the source code, the folder is under `public`.

All your game scripts, pictures, and portraits should be placed under the `game` folder corresponding to the game project. The following is a description of the resources corresponding to the directory:
